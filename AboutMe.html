            <h2>REDENTOR B. CORTEZ</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Redentor Cortez Welcome to my Portfolio first let me tell you about myself, On a daily basis, I am capable of handling many responsibilities and to tackle problems, I take a creative approach.
                I am a trustworthy individual who excels in time management and also I'm constantly upbeat and willing to pick up new abilities. There are many challenges ive faced in the past who made me who I am today
                like in the past i used to struggle in programming and not being able to communicate to my classmates but today i can code and i can talk freely to classmates. In life I have 2 kinds of goals long term and short term
                first is the short term, my goal is to keep studying and aquire more skills to help me in the future, my long term goal is that i can buy a house of my own and repay my parents to the sacrifice that they done
                to get me through college also live my life to the fullest. </p>
